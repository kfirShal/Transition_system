    "\n",
    "A farmer needs to cross a river with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. His boat can only carry himself plus one item. However, if he leaves the wolf alone with the goat, the wolf will eat the goat, and if he leaves the goat alone with the cabbage, the goat will eat the cabbage. The wolf and the cabbage can be left together safely. How can the farmer get all three safely across the river?*\n",

    "2. **Transitions:**\n",
    "   Moves consist of the farmer taking one item with him (or going alone) to the opposite bank, ensuring that the move doesn't violate the puzzle's constraints (i.e., leaving the wolf with the goat or the goat with the cabbage unsupervised).\n",
